# Creating Your First Assessment

## Goal
In this tutorial, you'll create and launch your first Mehmiro assessment, configure settings, and learn how to interpret the results to support your students' learning.

## Prerequisites
- Mehmiro teacher account access
- A class with students already set up
- 15-20 minutes for the complete tutorial

## Step 1: Access the Assessment Creation Wizard

1. **Log into your teacher dashboard**
2. **Navigate to the Assessments section**
   - Click "Assessments" in the main navigation
   - Select "Create New Assessment"

3. **Choose your assessment type**:
   - **Quiz**: Quick knowledge check (5-10 questions, 15-30 minutes)
   - **Test**: Comprehensive evaluation (10-20 questions, 30-60 minutes)  
   - **Practice**: Ungraded skill building (flexible questions, unlimited time)

**For this tutorial, select "Quiz" as it's perfect for getting started.**

## Step 2: Configure Basic Settings

### Assessment Information
1. **Title**: "Algebra I - Week 3 Quiz" (or your preferred naming convention)
2. **Description**: "This quiz covers quadratic equations and factoring"
3. **Instructions**: "You have 25 minutes to complete this quiz. You may use a calculator."

### Timing and Attempts
1. **Time Limit**: 25 minutes (recommended for beginner users)
2. **Number of Attempts**: 2 attempts allowed

## Step 3: Create Your Questions

### Method 1: Use the Question Bank (Recommended for beginners)

1. **Click "Add from Question Bank"**
2. **Select subject area**: Mathematics → Algebra
3. **Choose topic**: Quadratic Equations
4. **Filter by difficulty**: Mixed (or your preference)

**Select 5 questions from the bank:**

1. **Multiple Choice**: "Solve for x: x² + 5x + 6 = 0"
2. **Multiple Choice**: "Which method would you use to factor x² - 9?"
3. **Short Answer**: "Factor completely: 2x² + 7x + 3"
4. **Multiple Choice**: "What is the discriminant of 3x² + 2x - 1 = 0?"
5. **Calculated**: Custom calculation problem

### Method 2: Create Custom Questions

For each question:

1. **Question Type**: Choose from:
   - Multiple Choice (great for quick assessment)
   - Short Answer (for showing work)
   - True/False (for conceptual understanding)
   - Calculated (for numeric answers)

2. **Write your question**: Clear, concise, with single learning objective

3. **Provide correct answer**: And explain the reasoning

4. **Add distractors**: For multiple choice, include plausible wrong answers

## Step 4: Configure Feedback Settings

### Automated Feedback Options
1. **Immediate Feedback**: ✅ Show correct answer after each question
2. **Explanation**: ✅ Provide detailed explanation for wrong answers
3. **Hints**: ✅ Give hints for incorrect responses
4. **Progress Indicators**: ✅ Show completion progress

### Teacher Feedback
1. **Individual Comments**: ✅ Enable (allows personal notes)
2. **Audio Feedback**: ✅ Enable (record personal explanations)
3. **Resource Links**: ✅ Enable (share relevant study materials)

:::note
Students really appreciate getting explanations for incorrect answers. This helps them learn from mistakes rather than just seeing their score.

## Step 8: Review Results

### Immediate Results Overview
After submission, you'll see:

1. **Class Performance Summary**
   - Average score and completion time
   - Most challenging questions
   - Class-wide misconceptions

2. **Individual Student Results**
   - Detailed performance breakdown
   - Time spent per question
   - Areas needing support

### Key Metrics to Analyze
- **Question-Level Analysis**: Which questions were missed most?
- **Timing Analysis**: Did students run out of time?
- **Attempt Patterns**: Did second attempts improve scores?

## Step 9: Provide Follow-Up Support

### Using Insights for Instruction
1. **Identify Learning Gaps**: Focus on topics most students missed
2. **Target Individual Support**: Work with struggling students
3. **Celebrate Success**: Share positive results with class

### Action Items
- [ ] Schedule review session for difficult concepts
