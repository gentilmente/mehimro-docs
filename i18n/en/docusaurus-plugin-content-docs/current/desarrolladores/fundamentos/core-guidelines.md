# Core Guidelines

This document outlines the fundamental principles and guidelines that govern the development and maintenance of the Mehmiro platform.

## Development Philosophy

### User-Centric Design
- All features must prioritize the needs of teachers and students
- Interface design should be intuitive and accessible
- Performance should never compromise user experience

### Quality First
- Code must be thoroughly tested before deployment
- Documentation must be accurate and up-to-date
- Security considerations must be integrated into all features

### Iterative Improvement
- Features should be developed incrementally
- User feedback should drive feature enhancements
- Technical debt should be addressed proactively

## Technical Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow established coding standards and best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement comprehensive error handling

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- BDD scenarios for feature validation

### Documentation
- All features must be documented
- API endpoints must have clear specifications
- Code must be self-documenting where possible

## Process Guidelines

### Feature Development
1. Define requirements through BDD scenarios
2. Design architecture and data models
3. Implement with comprehensive testing
4. Document thoroughly
5. Deploy with monitoring

### Code Review
- All changes require peer review
- Reviews focus on code quality, security, and standards compliance
- Constructive feedback is encouraged

### Deployment
- Automated testing must pass before deployment
- Rollbacks must be possible
- Monitoring must be in place for new features

## Communication

### Internal Communication
- Use clear, concise language in all documentation
- Maintain transparency in development processes
- Encourage open discussion of technical decisions

### User Communication
- Provide clear onboarding and help resources
- Communicate feature changes proactively
- Maintain responsive support channels
